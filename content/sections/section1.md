## About me

Hi, I'm a student worker, passionate science and technology.

I'm studying Computer Science and Engineering at University of Bologna,
I attended Information and Communications Engineering at University of
Trento, and I'm working part-time as sysadmin/developer/IT help desk for a
small company. In my free time I usually listen a lot of music, read tecnical
articles, novels and comics and I experiment with single board computers, the
linux ecosystem in general, and with ham radio stuff.
